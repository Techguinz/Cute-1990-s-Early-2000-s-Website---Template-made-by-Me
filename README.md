# Cute-1990-s-Early-2000-s-Website---Template-made-by-Me
This is a website home project I conducted, where I developed an 'About Me' page relating to my hobbies, passions, and more. You may use this template to showcase anything you would like, below you can see a range of images of a example of the template in action using what I wrote for them. I will be uploading the code soon but for now here's some samples of the page.
